# Series-recommender


Welcome to the Series Recommender project! This project utilizes the `series-dataset-2023.csv` file to generate TV series recommendations. To get started, clone the repository and unzip the `rating.zip` file to extract the dataset. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`), which you can install using `pip install pandas matplotlib`. Open the `series_recommender.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook to access the data cleaning, analysis, and recommendation code. Happy analyzing!
